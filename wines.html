        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Gewurztraminer</strong> One of the most pungent wine varietals, it is easy to recognize by the heady, aromatic scent of roses, gardenias, or honeysuckle. A dry, full-bodied white, Gewurztraminer boasts exotic flavors of lychee, mango, grapefruit, or peach. It is excellent with fresh fruit and cheese and also pairs great with fish and poultry meals. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Harvest Moon</strong> This is our fall harvest blend. The blend consists of Riesling and Gewurztraminer. A great wine with your desserts or just a sweet glass of wine on its own. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Muscato</strong> The Muscat variety of grapes of the species Muscat is widely grown for wine, raisins and table grapes. Their color ranges from white to near black. Muscato almost always has a pronounced sweet floral aroma. Goes well with fresh fruit, cr&egrave;me brulee or on its own as dessert. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>PGB White</strong> This is our blend of Riesling and Viognier. This is our house white. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Riesling</strong> Possibly the best of all the white grapes due to the cellar longevity and it’s ability to maintain varietal identity. Riesling has distinctive floral aroma, reminiscent of rose petals or violets, mixed with tastes of apple, pear, and/or apricots. The delicate sweetness of this varietal works beautifully with simple seafood dishes or as a nice offset to a savory/spicy dish. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong> Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage and blanc due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. Goes great with Fish and cheese and one of the few wines that goes great with Sushi. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Viognier</strong> This varietal is well known for its floral aromas, due to terpenes. The color and the aroma of the wine suggest a sweet wine; Viognier wines are predominantly dry, although sweet. This grape has a low acidity. Pairs well with spicy foods such as Thai cuisine. $15</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong> Unlike most reds which tend towards berry flavors, this varietal leans toward a vegetative character. Earthy, even hints of leather are often used as descriptors. Fairly tannic when young, this wine ages very well into a softer edge with a bouquet of violet. $19</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon RESERVE</strong> This varietal is our take on the Washington State Cabernet Grape. We blend a little Merlot to help the middle palate and Barbera to provide just that extra bit of lift. Reticent aromas of cassis, chocolate and black cherry. Juicy, smooth and harmonious; not hugely complex but a very well-judged blend, a graceful, long finish featuring sweet, firm tannins. $25 (only 25 cases produced)</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Carmenere</strong> This French varietal is distinct in a few ways. A medium-bodied red, it is quite fruity with some earthy notes but, unlike most reds, it is better while young. This finicky grape is in demand yet hard to grow so feel lucky that you have a chance to try it! $19</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Merlot</strong> Merlot grapes are known for being very versatile as they can be great for a stand alone variety or as a blend with other reds. The flavors of black cherry, currant, and hints of cedar are buoyed but the low acidity and smoothness of this easy drinking red. Try this with salmon or lamb. $19</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Port Gardner Bay Red</strong> Our own blend of 90% Malbec and 10% Petite Verdot is a huge favorite. A blend you don’t see too often, this Malbec/Petit Verdot is lavish, juicy and fruity with blueberries, flowers, peaches and spicy oak. Goes great with steaks and lambs and other red meats but can also hold its own with Mexican food. $19</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Syrah</strong> Wines made from Syrah are often powerfully flavored and full-bodied. The variety produces wines with a wide range of flavor notes. Aroma characters can range from violets to berries (usually dark as opposed to red), chocolate, espresso and black pepper. Try with a Steak or Lamb even goes great with a pasta dish. $19</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa fa-glass"></i><strong>Wine Dog Red</strong> This is a blend of Sangiovese, Barbera and Cab Franc. One of our best sellers. It's sure to win you over too. $19</p><br></div>
