                <h3>Current wine list:</h3>
                <h4 class="wine-type">Reds:</h4>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Merlot</strong></p>
                <p>Merlot grapes are known for being very versatile as they can be great for a stand alone variety or as a blend with other reds. The flavors of black cherry, currant, and hints of cedar are buoyed, but the low acidity and smoothness of this wine make it an easy-drinking red. Try this with salmon or lamb and see why Merlot helped put the Washington wine industry on the world's wine map.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong></p>
                <p>Unlike most reds which tend towards berry flavors, this varietal leans toward a vegetative character. Earthy, even hints of leather are often used as descriptors. Fairly tannic when young, this wine ages very well into a softer edge with a bouquet of violet.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Malbec</strong></p>
                <p>PGB Red, our own blend of 90% Malbec and 10% Petite Verdot, is a crowd favorite. A blend you don't see often, this Malbec/Petit Verdot is lavish, juicy and fruity with blueberries, flowers, peaches and spicy oak. Characterized by dark fruit notes and herbal aromas, it pairs well with steaks and other red meats, but can also hold its own with Mexican food.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Carmenere</strong></p>
                <p>This French varietal is distinct in a few ways. A medium-bodied red, it is quite fruity with some earthy notes but, unlike most reds, it is better while young. This finicky grape is in demand yet hard to grow so feel lucky that you have a chance to try it!</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Syrah</strong></p>
                <p>Wines made from Syrah are often powerfully flavored and full-bodied. The variety produces wines with a wide range of flavor notes, Aroma characters range from violets to berries (usually dark as opposed to red), chocolate, espresso and black pepper. Try with a Steak or Lamb even goes great with a heavy pasta dish.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Sangiovese</strong></p>
                <p>When young, this ltalian wine grape has fresh fruity flavors of strawberry and a little spiciness, but readily takes on oaky flavors. lt has a flavor profile of sour red cherries with earthy aromas and tea leaf notes. This food-friendly wine is a classic pairings for tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces and can accentuate the flavors of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Rockefeller Red</strong></p>
                <p>Blaufränkisch (Lemberger) is a late-ripening variety, typically rich in tannin that exhibits a pronounced spicy character. This varietal becomes more velvety, supple and complex with time. With aromas of dark ripe cherries and dark berries and notes of red currants and blackberry fruit, this bold wine makes a great pairing for lamb dishes and grilled meats.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Colby Red</strong></p>
                <p>50% Blaufränkisch, 50% Merlot</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Blueberry</strong></p>
                <p>59% Blaufränkisch, 30% Merlot, 11% Blueberry</p>
                <h4 class="wine-type">Whites:</h4>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Chardonnay</strong></p>
                <p>Is the most well-known type of white wine grape. Aromatic yet delicate, our Chardonnay is full-bodied and buttery, with a lighter touch of oak than most. With flavors of pear, apple and citrus, it is wonderfully versatile. This wine is made for seafood and light pasta dishes.</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Riesling</strong></p>
                <p>Possibly the best of all the white grapes due to the cellar longevity and its ability to maintain varietal identity. Riesling has distinctive floral aroma, reminiscent of rose petals or violets, mixed with tastes of apple, pear, and/or apricots. The delicate sweetness of this varietal works beautifully with simple seafood dishes or as a nice offset to a savory/spicy dish.</p>

                <h3>Previous wines:</h3>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Gewurztraminer</strong></p>
                <p>One of the most pungent wine varietals, it is easy to recognize by the heady, aromatic scent of roses, gardenias, or honeysuckle. A dry, full-bodied white, Gewurztraminer boasts exotic flavors of lychee, mango, grapefruit, or peach. It is excellent with fresh fruit and cheese and also pairs great with fish and poultry meals. $15</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Harvest Moon</strong></p>
                <p>This is our fall harvest blend. The blend consists of Riesling and Gewurztraminer. A great wine with your desserts or just a sweet glass of wine on its own. $15</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Muscato</strong></p>
                <p>The Muscat variety of grapes of the species Muscat is widely grown for wine, raisins and table grapes. Their color ranges from white to near black.

                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>PGB White</strong></p>

                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Riesling</strong></p>
                <p>Possibly the best of all the white grapes due to the cellar longevity and it’s ability to maintain varietal identity.

                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong></p>
                <p>Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage and blanc due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. Goes great with Fish and cheese and one of the few wines that goes great with Sushi. $15</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Viognier</strong></p>
                <p>This varietal is well known for its floral aromas, due to terpenes. The color and the aroma of the wine suggest a sweet wine; Viognier wines are predominantly dry, although sweet. This grape has a low acidity. Pairs well with spicy foods such as Thai cuisine. $15</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong></p>
                <p>Unlike most reds which tend towards berry flavors, this varietal leans toward a vegetative character. Earthy, even hints of leather are often used as descriptors. Fairly tannic when young, this wine ages very well into a softer edge with a bouquet of violet. $19</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon RESERVE</strong></p>
                <p>This varietal is our take on the Washington State Cabernet Grape. We blend a little Merlot to help the middle palate and Barbera to provide just that extra bit of lift. Reticent aromas of cassis, chocolate and black cherry. Juicy, smooth and harmonious; not hugely complex but a very well-judged blend, a graceful, long finish featuring sweet, firm tannins. $25 (only 25 cases produced)</p>
                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Carmenere</strong></p>

                <p><img alt="wine in everett" src="images/PGBW-grapes.png"><strong>Port Gardner Bay Red</strong></p>
                <p>Our own blend of 90% Malbec and 10% Petite Verdot is a huge favorite. A blend you don’t see too often, this Malbec/Petit Verdot is lavish, juicy and fruity with blueberries, flowers, peaches and spicy oak. Goes great with steaks and lambs and other red meats but can also hold its own with Mexican food. $19</p>
